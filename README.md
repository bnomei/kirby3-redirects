## Setup

Add the `plugin-redirects` section to your `site.yml` and add redirects in the panel.

**site.yml**
```yaml
sections:
  # ...other sections
  redirects:
    extends: plugin-redirects
```

Since v1.1.0 the plugin will register itself with a `route:before`-hook and take care of the redirecting automatically. Many thanks to _Sebastian Aschenbach_ for suggesting this solution.

## Settings

All settings require `bnomei.redirects.` as prefix.

**code**
- default: `301`

**map**
- default: A closure to get the structure from `site.txt`. Define you own if you want the section to be in a different blueprint or skip the blueprint and just use code.
