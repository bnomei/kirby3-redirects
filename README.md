## Features

- ✏️ Define [HTTP Status Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#3xx_Redirection) redirects from within the **Kirby Panel**.
- 🔀 Setup redirects from any request URI to any response URI, not just Kirby routes.
- 🕵️ Match on query-strings like `?foo=bar` and forward data with regex `(?P<year>\d{4})`.
- 🛡️ Protects your website from attacks by blocking 50+ routes/patterns of other popular CMS.
- 🪝 With the hooks you can add custom logic like logging 404s.
- 🏎️ Highly performant due to caching on repeated valid requests.

## Installation

- unzip [master.zip](https://github.com/bnomei/kirby3-redirects/archive/master.zip) as folder
  `site/plugins/kirby3-redirects` or
- `git submodule add https://github.com/bnomei/kirby3-redirects.git site/plugins/kirby3-redirects` or
- `composer require bnomei/kirby3-redirects`

## Setup: add Redirects section to Site blueprint

Add the `plugin-redirects` section to your `site.yml`. This will allow you to create redirects in via the Panel or
programmatically.

**site/blueprints/site.yml**

```yaml
sections:
    # ...other sections
    redirects:
        extends: plugin-redirects3xx
```

> [!TIP]
> If you want to able to set all HTTP Status code from within the panel, not just the 3xx range, you can use
`extends: plugin-redirects` instead.

> [!TIP]
> Instead of using the site blueprint you can also use the `redirects` section in any pages blueprint as long as you
> adjust the `bnomei.redirects.map` option accordingly so the plugin knows where to find the redirects.

## Usage

In the Structure Field within the Panel add a Request-URIs `fromuri`, set a Response-URIs `touri` and a HTTP Status Code `code` like `301` or `302`.

| fromuri                                    | to                      | code  |
|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------|
| `projects/cool`                            | `projects/changed-slug` | `301` |
| `projects/cool.html`                       | `projects/changed-slug` | `301` |
| `projects\/.*\.html`                       | `projects/changed-slug` | `301` |
| `some/broken-link`                         | `https://exter.nal`     | `301` |
| `blog\/(?P<year>\d{4})_(?P<slug>.*)\.html` | `blog/$year/$slug`      | `301` |

## Exact redirects

For generated redirect maps with many known `301` redirects, use `bnomei.redirects.exact`. It is checked before the
Panel-managed `map` and only performs strict request URI lookups. Regex patterns and placeholders are intentionally not
processed in this list.

**site/config/config.php**

```php
return [
    'bnomei.redirects.exact' => fn () => require kirby()->root('site').'/redirects/exact.php',
];
```

**site/redirects/exact.php**

```php
<?php

return [
    '/old/path.htm' => '/new/path',
];
```

## Shielding your website from attacks

This plugin will **block 50+ routes/patterns** of other popular CMS. It is enabled by default and will reduce the load
on your website caused by bots/attackers looking for vulnerabilities found in other CMS.

- Drupal
- Joomla
- Magento
- Shopify
- Wordpress

You can track any redirects, including the blocked requests from the *shield*, using the `redirect:before` and
`404:before` hooks.

## Hooks

This plugin will trigger the following hooks, which you could use to build your own tracking or logging.

- `redirect:before($code, $redirect)`
- `404:before($route, $path, $method)`

**site/config/config.php**

```php
<?php 
return [
    'hooks' => [
        'redirect:before' => function (int $code, \Bnomei\Redirect $redirect) {
            // do whatever you need, like...
            monolog('redirect')->info($code, [
                'from' => $redirect->from(), 
                'to' => $redirect->to()
            ]);
        },
        '404:before' => function (\Kirby\Http\Route $route, string $path, string $method) {
            // do whatever you need, like...
            F::write(kirby()->root('logs').'/404.log', implode(' ', [
                '['.date('Y-m-d H:i:s').']',
                '404.ERROR',
                $method,
                $path,
                PHP_EOL,
            ]), true);
        },
    ],
    // other config...
];
```

## Programmatically changing the redirects table

The site methods `appendRedirects` and `removeRedirects` allow you to programmatically change the redirects table (if
stored in a Page/Site-Object Field, see `map` config option).

```php
// add single item
$success = site()->appendRedirects(
    ['fromuri' => '/posts?id=1', 'touri' => '/blog/1', 'code' => 301]
);

// add multiple items with nested array
$success = site()->appendRedirects([
    ['fromuri' => '/posts?id=2', 'touri' => '/blog/2', 'code' => 301],
    // ...
    ['fromuri' => '/posts?id=999', 'touri' => '/blog/999', 'code' => 301],
]);

// remove single item
$success = site()->removeRedirects(
    ['fromuri' => '/posts?id=1', 'touri' => '/blog/1']
);

// remove multiple items with nested array
$success = site()->removeRedirects([
    ['fromuri' => '/posts?id=3', 'touri' => '/blog/3'],
    ['fromuri' => '/posts?id=5', 'touri' => '/blog/5'],
    ['fromuri' => '/posts?id=7', 'touri' => '/blog/7'],
]);
```

## Performance

Redirects are checked against exact redirect entries first and then against the configured redirect map. Unmatched public
requests are not written to the cache.

## Similar Plugins

- [kirby-retour](https://github.com/distantnative/kirby-retour) while featuring a nice UI and built-in 404 tracking it
  can only handle Kirby routes (with pattern matching) but not any request URI.
